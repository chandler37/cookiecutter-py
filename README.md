# Python package starter template

This is such a thing, and of the highest quality.


## Making your own cookie (metaphorically)

If you do not have `python3` in your `PATH`, install
[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) and then run `brew install python`.

Install the latest Cookiecutter if you haven't:

```
pip3 install -U cookiecutter
```

Generate a Python package project:

```
cookiecutter https://github.com/chandler37/cookiecutter-py.git
```
